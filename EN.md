> [!WARNING]
> **For those who use the script, you might have noticed it stopped working. This is because wplace was updated and now it sends a captcha every 2 minutes, making it really hard to run bots. But I’ve already found a way, and I’m working on it as fast as I can for you. Big thanks from the heart to everyone who’s helping with this project <3**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> <p><sub><strong>1.</strong> None of the scripts will work if you close the browser tab. You must keep the WPlace tab open, even if it's in the background.</sub></p>
> <p><sub><strong>2.</strong> Never run both scripts on the same page — this can bug your WPlace. If it happens, just refresh the page!</sub></p>
> <p><sub><strong>3.</strong> If the script doesn’t detect the available colors, just click the "Paint" button to show them — only then start the Auto-Imager.</sub></p>
